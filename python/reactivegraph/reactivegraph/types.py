"""Engine-level primitives shared by every host binding.

``Overwrite`` is part of the state-update contract, not of any one host: a
node that returns ``Overwrite(value)`` asks the channel to replace its
accumulated value instead of merging through the reducer. The class also
recognises the two serialized forms the value can take after a JSON round
trip, because a wrapper must survive transport between processes. When
LangGraph is importable the engine class *subclasses* the host class, because
the host's own ``BinaryOperatorAggregate.update`` checks
``isinstance(value, langgraph.types.Overwrite)`` before it bypasses the
reducer; a look-alike class would be fed to the reducer and raise.

``Interrupt`` is the *payload* a paused node surfaces to its client. It is
deliberately not an exception: middleware that catches ``Exception`` to wrap
ordinary failures must never swallow a human-in-the-loop pause. The control
flow signal is :class:`reactivegraph.errors.GraphInterrupt`.
